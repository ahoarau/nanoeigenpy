      "LU decomposition of a matrix with partial pivoting, and "
      "related features. \n\n"
      "This class represents a LU decomposition of a square "
      "invertible matrix, with partial pivoting: the matrix "
      "A is decomposed as A = PLU where L is unit-lower-triangular, "
      "U is upper-triangular, and P is a permutation matrix.\n\n"
      "Typically, partial pivoting LU decomposition is only considered "
      "numerically stable for square invertible matrices. Thus LAPACK's "
      "dgesv and dgesvx require the matrix to be square and invertible. "
      "The present class does the same. It will assert that the matrix is "
      "square, but it won't (actually it can't) check that the matrix is "
      "invertible: it is your task to check that you only use this "
      "decomposition on invertible matrices.\n\n"
      "The guaranteed safe alternative, working for all matrices, is the "
      "full pivoting LU decomposition, provided by class FullPivLU.\n\n"
      "This is not a rank-revealing LU decomposition. Many features are "
      "intentionally absent from this class, such as rank computation. If "
      "you need these features, use class FullPivLU.\n\n"
      "This LU decomposition is suitable to invert invertible matrices. "
      "It is what MatrixBase::inverse() uses in the general case. On the "
      "other hand, it is not suitable to determine whether a given matrix "
      "is invertible.\n\n"
      "The data of the LU decomposition can be directly accessed through "
      "the methods matrixLU(), permutationP().")
